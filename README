This is COPES (COllect PErmissionS), a tool to extract permission checks from
the Android Framework.

This tool has initialiy been developed by Alexandre Bartel for the experiments
in the following research papers:

 Alexandre Bartel, Jacques Klein, Martin Monperrus, Yves Le Traon: Static
 Analysis for Extracting Permission Checks of a Large Scale Framework: The
 Challenges And Solutions for Analyzing Android, in IEEE Transactions of
 Software Engineering (TSE), 2014

 Alexandre Bartel, Jacques Klein, Martin Monperrus, Yves Le Traon:
 Automatically Securing Permission-Based Software by Reducing the Attack
 Surface: An Application to Android, in IEEE/ACM International Conference on
 Automated Software Engineering (ASE), Essen, Germany, 2012

How to compile?

1) Import COPES in eclipse
2) Import Soot and all its dependencies
3) Eclipse should compile COPES in ./bin/

How to use?
